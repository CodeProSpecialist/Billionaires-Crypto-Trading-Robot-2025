### Core Philosophy – Why This Bot Exists

On **Cryptocurrency exchanges** (and almost every altcoin market), the period between **18:00 CST and 08:00 CST** is statistically the most dangerous time of the entire day.

During U.S. night + Asian morning session:
- Almost zero real buying volume
- Razor-thin order books
- Any selling pressure causes cascading 10–30 % deflationary crashes

**Holding altcoins overnight on Binance.US = the highest-risk gamble you can take.**

That’s why **INFINITY GRID PLATINUM 2025 treats the daily full exit as 100 % MANDATORY**.  
Starting at **17:30 CST every single day**, the bot will relentlessly sell **everything** using aggressive but controlled limit orders until the portfolio is **100 % USDT — no exceptions, no excuses**.

Only after confirming you are completely flat does it allow itself to sleep safely overnight.

### Installation in Ubuntu 24.04 Linux (Anaconda Python Environment Preferred)

For optimal isolation and management of dependencies, use Anaconda. This setup ensures a controlled Python environment, avoiding conflicts with system Python.

#### Step-by-Step Anaconda Installation
1. **Download the Anaconda Installer**:  
   Open a terminal and download the latest Linux installer (as of October 2025, check for updates at https://www.anaconda.com/download):  
   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Installer**:  
   Execute the script:  
   ```bash
   bash Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```  
   - Press `Enter` to review the license.  
   - Scroll with `Space` and type `yes` to accept.  
   - Confirm the default path (e.g., `/home/yourusername/anaconda3`) by pressing `Enter`.  
   - Type `yes` to initialize Conda (this adds setup to `.bashrc`).

3. **Reload Shell Configuration**:  
   Apply changes:  
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```  
   Your terminal should show `(base)` indicating the base environment is active.

4. **Create a New Conda Environment**:  
   Create an isolated environment for the bot (e.g., with Python 3.11):  
   ```bash
   conda create -n trading_bot python=3.11
   ```  
   Activate it:  
   ```bash
   conda activate trading_bot
   ```  
   (To deactivate later: `conda deactivate`.)


5. **Verify Installation**:  
   Run `conda list` to check packages. Test Python:  
   ```bash
   python -c "print('Hello, Anaconda!')"
   ```

Step-by-Step Guide to Create API Keys

Log In to Your Binance.US Account:

Go to www.binance.us and sign in with your credentials.


Access API Management:

Hover over your profile icon or email address in the upper right corner of the dashboard.
From the dropdown menu, select API Management (or Settings > API Management).


Create a New API Key:

In the API Management section, enter a descriptive name for your key (e.g., "Trading Bot Key").
Click Create API (or Create).
Complete 2FA verification (e.g., Google Authenticator or SMS code).
Confirm via email verification from Binance.US.


Copy Your Keys:

Your API Key and Secret Key will be displayed once—copy and save them securely (e.g., in a password manager).
The Secret Key will be hidden forever after you leave the page. If lost, delete the key and create a new one.


Configure Permissions (API Restrictions):

Defaults to Read-Only—ideal for data access (e.g., portfolio tracking).
For trading bots: Enable Spot Trading if needed (allows buying/selling), but NEVER enable Withdrawals unless absolutely required, as it risks fund theft.
IP Restrictions: Add trusted IP addresses (e.g., your server's IP) to limit access. Leave unrestricted only if necessary.
Click Save or Confirm to apply.
********

#### What to Add to `.bashrc` in Ubuntu Linux
The Anaconda installer automatically adds Conda initialization to `~/.bashrc` (e.g., export PATH and conda setup block). For the bot's environment variables (used via `os.getenv`), add these exports at the end of `~/.bashrc` (replace placeholders with your actual values):

```bash
# Environment variables for This Crypto Trading Robot

export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_binance_api_key_here"
export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_binance_api_secret_here"
export CALLMEBOT_API_KEY="your_callmebot_api_key_here"
export CALLMEBOT_PHONE="your_phone_number_here"  # E.g., +1234567890
```

Run Program: 

```bash
conda activate 
python3 infinity_grid_live.py
```

**Note**: Ensure the bot script is saved as `infinity_grid_live.py`.  

This setup is for educational use; live trading carries significant risks, including the potential to **lose all or part of your investment**, as outlined in the disclaimers. 

To set up CallMeBot for WhatsApp, visit https://www.callmebot.com/ and follow the instructions to get your API key and configure the service. Then, use `curl` or Python to send messages via the API.

This setup is for educational use; live trading carries significant risks, including the potential to **lose all or part of your investment**, as outlined in the disclaimers.
