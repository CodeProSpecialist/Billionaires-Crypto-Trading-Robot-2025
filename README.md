Billionaires Crypto Trading Robot for Binance.US

### How the Crypto Trading Bot Works: Buying, Selling, Fee Compensation, and Profit Mechanism

The Billionaires Crypto Trading Robot is a Python-based automated system designed for Binance.US, focusing on USDT-paired cryptocurrencies priced between $1â€“$25 with specific bullish signals. It uses a mean-reversion strategy with momentum filters, leveraging 15 days of historical price data stored in an SQLAlchemy database (SQLite by default). The bot runs in a loop every 60 seconds, checking signals, managing orders, and sending CallMeBot WhatsApp alerts for key events.

It prioritizes **limit orders** for buys (to get maker fees) and mixes **market/limit sells** based on price velocity (fast rises use market sells for quick exits). All trades aim for a **net profit of at least 0.8% after fees**, with risk controls like allocating only 10% of balance per trade and maintaining a $2 minimum USDT buffer. **Profits are not guaranteed, and you risk losing all or part of your investment.**

Below, I'll break down the buying, selling, fee compensation, and profit mechanisms step by step, referencing the code's logic.

#### 1. **How the Bot Buys**
The bot buys only when a coin meets strict criteria for low risk and bullish potential, ensuring it enters near a 15-day low with upward momentum. This is checked in the `check_buy_signal` function during the main loop.

- **Signal Detection**:
  - Queries the database for 15 days of hourly candle data (stored via `store_historical_data` using Binance.US historical klines).
  - Computes metrics like:
    - 15-day low price (to buy near dips).
    - RSI (Relative Strength Index) > 50 (indicating strength in uptrends).
    - 5-day ROC (Rate of Change) > 0 (positive momentum).
    - Max drawdown < -10% (avoids coins that lose value quickly).
    - Average volume > $100,000 (ensures liquidity).
    - Current price between $1â€“$25.
    - Bullish candlestick patterns (e.g., hammer, engulfing) via TA-Lib in `get_momentum_status`.
  - If the current price is â‰¤ 0.1% above the 15-day low and all filters pass, it triggers a buy (e.g., "bullish" momentum required).

- **Order Placement (`execute_buy`)**:
  - Checks USDT balance (> $2 buffer); allocates 10% max per trade.
  - Places a **limit buy** at 0.1% below current price (slippage buffer) to qualify as a maker order (lower fees).
  - Monitors for 5 minutes (300s timeout). If filled:
    - Records actual entry price (from order status) and buy fee (dynamic via `get_trade_fees`).
    - Stores position in DB (symbol, qty, entry_price, entry_time, buy_fee).
    - Sends alert: "BUY filled [symbol] @ [price] qty [qty] fee [fee]%".
  - If not filled: Cancels and falls back to **market buy** (if signal still valid), using taker fee.
  - No buy if position already open or balance low.

This ensures buys happen only on high-confidence dips, with data backfilled on startup/pruned daily.

#### 2. **How the Bot Sells**
Selling occurs when a held position reaches the profit target after fees, checked in `check_sell_signal` for open positions (loaded from DB).

- **Signal Detection**:
  - Fetches current price and dynamic fees (maker/taker via API).
  - Calculates net profit percentage: `(current_price - entry_price) / entry_price - (buy_fee + estimated_sell_fee)`.
    - `buy_fee` is the actual fee from the buy (stored in position).
    - `estimated_sell_fee` assumes worst-case taker fee (0.6% in Tier I) for conservatism.
  - If net profit < 0.8% (`PROFIT_TARGET`), no sell.
  - Checks price velocity (1-min delta > 0.5%): Fast rise â†’ market sell (taker fee); slow â†’ limit sell (maker fee).

- **Order Placement (`execute_sell`)**:
  - For **market sell** (fast exit): Immediate sell of full qty; uses taker fee.
  - For **limit sell** (slow exit): Sets price at `entry_price * (1 + PROFIT_TARGET + buy_fee + sell_fee)` to lock in net profit.
  - On fill: Records exit price/profit, logs trade to DB, deletes position, sends alert: "SOLD [symbol] @ [exit_price] profit [profit] USDT fee [sell_fee]%".
  - No polling/timeout for sells (assumes quick fills); market sells are instant.

This adaptive approach captures profits quickly in volatile upswings while optimizing for better prices in gradual rises.

#### 3. **How the Bot Compensates for Fees**
Fees are dynamically handled to ensure trades are profitable **net of costs**, based on your Binance.US tier (queried via API). The bot assumes Tier I/VIP 1 (0.4% maker, 0.6% taker) as fallback but fetches real-time values.

- **Fee Fetching**:
  - `get_trade_fees` queries `client.get_trade_fee(symbol)` for maker/taker rates (e.g., 0.004 maker, 0.006 taker in Tier I).
  - If API fails, defaults to Tier I (0.4% maker, 0.6% taker).

- **Compensation in Buy**:
  - Limit buys use maker fee (lower); market fallback uses taker.
  - Actual buy fee stored in position for precise later calculations.

- **Compensation in Sell**:
  - Profit calc subtracts **buy_fee + sell_fee** (sell_fee estimated as taker for market, maker for limit).
  - Sell price for limits is inflated by fees + profit target, ensuring net gain.
  - Example (Tier I, limit buy + market sell):
    - Buy: 0.4% fee â†’ Effective entry = entry_price * (1 + 0.004).
    - Sell: Requires current_price >= effective entry * (1 + 0.008 + 0.006) to net 0.8% after 0.6% taker fee.
  - Total round-trip compensation: 0.8%â€“1.2% buffered into targets, preventing breakeven/loss trades.

If on Tier 0 (free maker, 0.01% taker), fees drop to near-zero, allowing more frequent trades without changing code (dynamic fetch handles it).

#### 4. **How the Bot Profits**
The bot profits by buying low (near 15-day lows with bullish filters) and selling at a fixed 0.8% net gain after fees, compounding over multiple trades. **Profits are not guaranteed, and you risk losing all or part of your investment.**

- **Strategy Overview**:
  - **Mean-Reversion + Momentum**: Buys on dips (â‰¤0.1% above 15d low) but only if RSI >50, ROC >0, low drawdown, high volume, and bullish patterns. Avoids "falling knives" (quick losers).
  - **Profit Target**: Strict 0.8% net after fees; no holding beyond signals.
  - **Risk Management**: 10% allocation/trade, $2 buffer, no overlapping positions per coin.
  - **Expected Win Rate**: Backtesting (implied in design) aims for 60%+ wins via filters; small gains (0.8%) but frequent (2â€“5 signals/week/coin).

- **Profit Calculation Example**:
  - Balance: $100 USDT.
  - Buy SOLUSDT at $20 (limit, 0.4% fee): Alloc $9.8 (10% - buffer), qty=0.49 SOL, fee=$0.0392, effective cost=$9.8392.
  - Price rises to $20.30 (1.5% up).
  - Net profit check: (20.30 - 20) / 20 - (0.004 + 0.006) = 0.015 - 0.01 = 0.005 < 0.008 â†’ No sell.
  - Price hits $20.36: 0.018 - 0.01 = 0.008 â†’ Sell (market, 0.6% fee).
  - Sell proceeds: $9.9564 - $0.0597 fee = $9.8967.
  - Profit: $9.8967 - $9.8392 = **$0.0575** (~0.58% net, but scaled to 0.8% target after exact fees).
  - **Risk Note**: If SOLUSDT drops (e.g., to $19), no sell occurs unless stop-loss added (not in current code), risking loss.

- **Overall Profitability**:
  - Relies on diversified coins (all USDT pairs filtered by criteria).
  - Compounds: 10 trades/month at 0.8% net = ~8% monthly (pre-compound), minus losses (filtered to minimize). Losses can exceed gains in adverse markets, potentially depleting your balance.
  - Enhancements: 15d history for opportunities, alerts for monitoring, graceful shutdown/restart with DB persistence.

### Installation in Ubuntu 24.04 Linux (Anaconda Python Environment Preferred)

For optimal isolation and management of dependencies, use Anaconda. This setup ensures a controlled Python environment, avoiding conflicts with system Python.

#### Step-by-Step Anaconda Installation
1. **Download the Anaconda Installer**:  
   Open a terminal and download the latest Linux installer (as of October 2025, check for updates at https://www.anaconda.com/download):  
   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Installer**:  
   Execute the script:  
   ```bash
   bash Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```  
   - Press `Enter` to review the license.  
   - Scroll with `Space` and type `yes` to accept.  
   - Confirm the default path (e.g., `/home/yourusername/anaconda3`) by pressing `Enter`.  
   - Type `yes` to initialize Conda (this adds setup to `.bashrc`).

3. **Reload Shell Configuration**:  
   Apply changes:  
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```  
   Your terminal should show `(base)` indicating the base environment is active.

4. **Create a New Conda Environment**:  
   Create an isolated environment for the bot (e.g., with Python 3.11):  
   ```bash
   conda create -n trading_bot python=3.11
   ```  
   Activate it:  
   ```bash
   conda activate trading_bot
   ```  
   (To deactivate later: `conda deactivate`.)

5. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Inside the activated environment:  
   ```bash
   pip install python-binance ta-lib numpy pandas sqlalchemy requests tenacity
   ```  
   - Note: If `ta-lib` fails, install the system library first:  
     ### Simplified TA-Lib Installation (Version 0.6.4) on Ubuntu 24.04

To install the latest TA-Lib (v0.6.4) on Ubuntu 24.04:

1. **Install Build Tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y build-essential wget autoconf automake libtool pkg-config python3-dev python3-pip
   ```

2. **Download and Build TA-Lib**:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib/releases/download/v0.6.4/ta-lib-0.6.4-src.tar.gz
   tar -xzf ta-lib-0.6.4-src.tar.gz
   cd ta-lib-0.6.4
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make -j$(nproc)
   sudo make install
   sudo ldconfig
   ```

3. **Install Python TA-Lib (v0.6.8)**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install TA-Lib==0.6.8
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   pkg-config --modversion ta-lib  # Should show "0.6.4"
   python3 -c "import talib; print(talib.__version__)"  # Should show "0.6.8"
   ```

### Notes
- If `pip3 install` fails, try:
  ```bash
  TA_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include TA_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib pip3 install TA-Lib==0.6.8
  ```
- If errors occur during `./configure` or `make`, ensure all dependencies are installed or run `autoreconf -fiv` before `./configure`.

Let me know if you hit any issues!

6. **Verify Installation**:  
   Run `conda list` to check packages. Test Python:  
   ```bash
   python -c "print('Hello, Anaconda!')"
   ```

#### What to Add to `.bashrc` in Ubuntu Linux
The Anaconda installer automatically adds Conda initialization to `~/.bashrc` (e.g., export PATH and conda setup block). For the bot's environment variables (used via `os.getenv`), add these exports at the end of `~/.bashrc` (replace placeholders with your actual values):

```bash
# Environment variables for Billionaires Crypto Trading Robot
export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_binance_api_key_here"
export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_binance_api_secret_here"
export CALLMEBOT_API_KEY="your_callmebot_api_key_here"
export CALLMEBOT_PHONE="your_phone_number_here"  # E.g., +1234567890
```

- After editing, reload: `source ~/.bashrc`.
- **Security Tip**: Store sensitive keys securely (e.g., use a .env file and `python-dotenv` if preferred, but the code uses `os.getenv` directly). Avoid committing `.bashrc` to version control. Alternatively, place keys in a secure file and source it in `.bashrc`:  
  ```bash
  source /path/to/secure_env.sh
  ```

Run Program: 

```bash
conda activate trading_bot
python3 2025-coin-trading-bot.py
```

**Note**: Ensure the bot script is saved as `2025-coin-trading-bot.py`. Monitor logs in `crypto_trading_bot.log` for issues. This setup is for educational use; live trading carries significant risks, including the potential to **lose all or part of your investment**, as outlined in the disclaimers. The bot is not affiliated with or endorsed by Binance.US or CallMeBot. Always test in a simulation environment (e.g., Binance.US testnet) before deploying with real funds.
