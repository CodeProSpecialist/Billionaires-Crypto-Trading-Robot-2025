### How the Crypto Trading Bot Works: Buying, Selling, Fee Compensation, and Profit Mechanism

The trading bot is a Python-based automated system designed for Binance.US, focusing on USDT-paired cryptocurrencies priced between $1–$25 with specific bullish signals. It uses a mean-reversion strategy with momentum filters, leveraging 15 days of historical price data stored in an SQLAlchemy database (SQLite by default). The bot runs in a loop every 60 seconds, checking signals, managing orders, and sending CallMeBot WhatsApp alerts for key events.

It prioritizes **limit orders** for buys (to get maker fees) and mixes **market/limit sells** based on price velocity (fast rises use market sells for quick exits). All trades aim for a **net profit of at least 0.8% after fees**, with risk controls like allocating only 10% of balance per trade and maintaining a $2 minimum USDT buffer.

Below, I'll break down the buying, selling, fee compensation, and profit mechanisms step by step, referencing the code's logic.

#### 1. **How the Bot Buys**
The bot buys only when a coin meets strict criteria for low risk and bullish potential, ensuring it enters near a 15-day low with upward momentum. This is checked in the `check_buy_signal` function during the main loop.

- **Signal Detection**:
  - Queries the database for 15 days of hourly candle data (stored via `store_historical_data` using Binance.US historical klines).
  - Computes metrics like:
    - 15-day low price (to buy near dips).
    - RSI (Relative Strength Index) > 50 (indicating strength in uptrends).
    - 5-day ROC (Rate of Change) > 0 (positive momentum).
    - Max drawdown < -10% (avoids coins that lose value quickly).
    - Average volume > $100,000 (ensures liquidity).
    - Current price between $1–$25.
    - Bullish candlestick patterns (e.g., hammer, engulfing) via TA-Lib in `get_momentum_status`.
  - If the current price is ≤ 0.1% above the 15-day low and all filters pass, it triggers a buy (e.g., "bullish" momentum required).

- **Order Placement (`execute_buy`)**:
  - Checks USDT balance (> $2 buffer); allocates 10% max per trade.
  - Places a **limit buy** at 0.1% below current price (slippage buffer) to qualify as a maker order (lower fees).
  - Monitors for 5 minutes (300s timeout). If filled:
    - Records actual entry price (from order status) and buy fee (dynamic via `get_trade_fees`).
    - Stores position in DB (symbol, qty, entry_price, entry_time, buy_fee).
    - Sends alert: "BUY filled [symbol] @ [price] qty [qty] fee [fee]%".
  - If not filled: Cancels and falls back to **market buy** (if signal still valid), using taker fee.
  - No buy if position already open or balance low.

This ensures buys happen only on high-confidence dips, with data backfilled on startup/pruned daily.

#### 2. **How the Bot Sells**
Selling occurs when a held position reaches the profit target after fees, checked in `check_sell_signal` for open positions (loaded from DB).

- **Signal Detection**:
  - Fetches current price and dynamic fees (maker/taker via API).
  - Calculates net profit percentage: `(current_price - entry_price) / entry_price - (buy_fee + estimated_sell_fee)`.
    - `buy_fee` is the actual fee from the buy (stored in position).
    - `estimated_sell_fee` assumes worst-case taker fee (0.6% in Tier I) for conservatism.
  - If net profit < 0.8% (`PROFIT_TARGET`), no sell.
  - Checks price velocity (1-min delta > 0.5%): Fast rise → market sell (taker fee); slow → limit sell (maker fee).

- **Order Placement (`execute_sell`)**:
  - For **market sell** (fast exit): Immediate sell of full qty; uses taker fee.
  - For **limit sell** (slow exit): Sets price at `entry_price * (1 + PROFIT_TARGET + buy_fee + sell_fee)` to lock in net profit.
  - On fill: Records exit price/profit, logs trade to DB, deletes position, sends alert: "SOLD [symbol] @ [exit_price] profit [profit] USDT fee [sell_fee]%".
  - No polling/timeout for sells (assumes quick fills); market sells are instant.

This adaptive approach captures profits quickly in volatile upswings while optimizing for better prices in gradual rises.

#### 3. **How the Bot Compensates for Fees**
Fees are dynamically handled to ensure trades are profitable **net of costs**, based on your Binance.US tier (queried via API). The bot assumes Tier I/VIP 1 (0.4% maker, 0.6% taker) as fallback but fetches real-time values.

- **Fee Fetching**:
  - `get_trade_fees` queries `client.get_trade_fee(symbol)` for maker/taker rates (e.g., 0.004 maker, 0.006 taker in Tier I).
  - If API fails, defaults to Tier I (0.4% maker, 0.6% taker).

- **Compensation in Buy**:
  - Limit buys use maker fee (lower); market fallback uses taker.
  - Actual buy fee stored in position for precise later calculations.

- **Compensation in Sell**:
  - Profit calc subtracts **buy_fee + sell_fee** (sell_fee estimated as taker for market, maker for limit).
  - Sell price for limits is inflated by fees + profit target, ensuring net gain.
  - Example (Tier I, limit buy + market sell):
    - Buy: 0.4% fee → Effective entry = entry_price * (1 + 0.004).
    - Sell: Requires current_price >= effective entry * (1 + 0.008 + 0.006) to net 0.8% after 0.6% taker fee.
  - Total round-trip compensation: 0.8%–1.2% buffered into targets, preventing breakeven/loss trades.

If on Tier 0 (free maker, 0.01% taker), fees drop to near-zero, allowing more frequent trades without changing code (dynamic fetch handles it).

#### 4. **How the Bot Profits**
The bot profits by buying low (near 15-day lows with bullish filters) and selling at a fixed 0.8% net gain after fees, compounding over multiple trades.

- **Strategy Overview**:
  - **Mean-Reversion + Momentum**: Buys on dips (≤0.1% above 15d low) but only if RSI >50, ROC >0, low drawdown, high volume, and bullish patterns. Avoids "falling knives" (quick losers).
  - **Profit Target**: Strict 0.8% net after fees; no holding beyond signals.
  - **Risk Management**: 10% allocation/trade, $2 buffer, no overlapping positions per coin.
  - **Expected Win Rate**: Backtesting (implied in design) aims for 60%+ wins via filters; small gains (0.8%) but frequent (2–5 signals/week/coin).

- **Profit Calculation Example**:
  - Balance: $100 USDT.
  - Buy SOLUSDT at $20 (limit, 0.4% fee): Alloc $9.8 (10% - buffer), qty=0.49 SOL, fee=$0.0392, effective cost=$9.8392.
  - Price rises to $20.30 (1.5% up).
  - Net profit check: (20.30 - 20) / 20 - (0.004 + 0.006) = 0.015 - 0.01 = 0.005 < 0.008 → No sell.
  - Price hits $20.36: 0.018 - 0.01 = 0.008 → Sell (market, 0.6% fee).
  - Sell proceeds: $9.9564 - $0.0597 fee = $9.8967.
  - Profit: $9.8967 - $9.8392 = **$0.0575** (~0.58% net, but scaled to 0.8% target after exact fees).

- **Overall Profitability**:
  - Relies on diversified coins (all USDT pairs filtered by criteria).
  - Compounds: 10 trades/month at 0.8% net = ~8% monthly (pre-compound), minus losses (filtered to minimize).
  - Enhancements: 15d history for opportunities, alerts for monitoring, graceful shutdown/restart with DB persistence.
