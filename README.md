### How the Crypto Trading Bot Works: Buying, Selling, Fee Compensation, and Profit Mechanism

The Billionaires Crypto Trading Robot is a Python-based automated system designed for Binance.US, focusing on USDT-paired cryptocurrencies priced between $1â€“$1000 with specific bullish signals. It uses a mean-reversion strategy enhanced with comprehensive indicators including RSI, MACD, MFI, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator, ATR, SMA, EMA, and candlestick patterns, leveraging 60 days of historical price data (1-hour klines) stored in an SQLAlchemy database (SQLite by default). The bot runs in a loop every 60 seconds, checking signals, managing orders, processing filled orders, and sending CallMeBot WhatsApp alerts for key events. It also prints a professional dashboard to the console for real-time status monitoring.

On startup, it imports all owned nonzero-balance assets (any pair convertible to USDT) as tracked positions, using current market prices as entry points for profit calculations. It prioritizes **limit orders** for buys (to get maker fees) with a 300-second timeout and adaptive sells (market for urgent exits based on bearish signals, limit otherwise). All trades aim for a **net profit of at least 0.8% after fees**, with risk controls like allocating only 10% of balance per trade and maintaining a $2 minimum USDT buffer. **Profits are not guaranteed, and you risk losing all or part of your investment.**

Below, I'll break down the buying, selling, fee compensation, and profit mechanisms step by step, referencing the code's logic.

#### 1. **How the Bot Buys**
The bot buys only when a coin meets strict criteria for low risk and bullish potential, ensuring it enters near the lower Bollinger Band with oversold conditions and upward trend signals. This is checked in the `check_buy_signal` function during the main loop for symbols without existing positions.

- **Signal Detection**:
  - Queries the database and fetches 60 days of 1-hour kline data via Binance.US API.
  - Computes metrics like:
    - RSI (14-period) > 50 (indicating strength).
    - MFI (Money Flow Index, 14-period) â‰¤ 70 (avoids overbought).
    - MACD (12,26,9) > signal line and histogram > 0 (bullish momentum).
    - Stochastic Oscillator (5,3,3) K% â‰¤ 30 (oversold).
    - EMA (21-period) > SMA (50-period) (uptrend confirmation).
    - Current price â‰¤ lower Bollinger Band (20-period, 2-dev) * 1.005 (near oversold band).
    - Bullish candlestick patterns (e.g., hammer, inverted hammer, engulfing, morning star, three white soldiers) via TA-Lib in `is_bullish_candlestick_pattern`.
    - Bullish momentum status via TA-Lib patterns in `get_momentum_status`.
    - 24-hour quote volume > $15,000 (ensures liquidity).
    - Current price between $1â€“$1000.
  - If all filters pass, it triggers a buy.

- **Order Placement (`execute_buy` and `place_limit_buy_with_tracking`)**:
  - Checks USDT balance (> $2 buffer); allocates 10% max per trade.
  - Calculates buy price as current price * (1 - 0.001 - 0.5 * ATR / current price), where ATR is 14-period for volatility buffer.
  - Places a **limit buy** to qualify as a maker order (lower fees), adjusted for symbol filters (lot size, price tick, min notional).
  - Tracks the order in the database as a PendingOrder and monitors for fills in `check_and_process_filled_orders`.
  - On fill (polled in main loop): Records actual entry price, quantity, and buy fee rate (dynamic via `get_trade_fees`).
  - Stores or updates position in DB (symbol, qty, avg_entry_price, buy_fee_rate).
  - Sends alert: e.g., "BUY filled [symbol] @ [price] qty [qty]".
  - No buy if position already open, balance low, or signal invalid.

This ensures buys happen only on high-confidence oversold entries in uptrends, with data fetched on demand and persistence for restarts.

#### 2. **How the Bot Sells**
Selling occurs when a held position (including imported assets) reaches the profit target after fees, checked in `check_sell_signal` for all open positions (loaded from DB).

- **Signal Detection**:
  - Fetches current price and dynamic fees (maker/taker via API).
  - Calculates net profit percentage: `(current_price - avg_entry_price) / avg_entry_price - (buy_fee_rate + sell_fee)`.
    - `buy_fee_rate` is the stored rate from the buy (or default 0.1%).
    - `sell_fee` assumes taker for market sells (urgent) or maker for limit.
  - If net profit < 0.8% (`PROFIT_TARGET`), no sell.
  - Determines sell type: Market if bearish candlestick patterns (e.g., shooting star, hanging man, engulfing) or current price â‰¥ upper Bollinger Band * 0.995; otherwise limit.

- **Order Placement (`execute_sell`, `place_market_sell`, `place_limit_sell_with_tracking`)**:
  - For **market sell** (urgent exit): Immediate sell of full qty; uses taker fee.
  - For **limit sell** (controlled exit): Sets price at `avg_entry_price * (1 + PROFIT_TARGET + buy_fee_rate + sell_fee)` + 0.5 * ATR to lock in net profit with volatility buffer.
  - Adjusts for symbol filters (lot size, price tick, min notional).
  - Tracks limit sells as PendingOrder; processes fills in main loop.
  - On fill: Records exit price/profit, logs trade to DB, deletes position, sends alert: "SOLD [symbol] @ [exit_price] Profit $[profit]".
  - Market sells are instant; limit sells are polled via order status.

This adaptive approach captures profits while responding to bearish signals for quick exits in volatile conditions.

#### 3. **How the Bot Compensates for Fees**
Fees are dynamically handled to ensure trades are profitable **net of costs**, based on your Binance.US tier (queried via API). The bot fetches real-time maker/taker rates (defaults to 0.1% if API fails).

- **Fee Fetching**:
  - `get_trade_fees` queries `client.get_trade_fee(symbol)` for maker/taker rates (e.g., 0.001 maker, 0.001 taker in lower tiers).

- **Compensation in Buy**:
  - Limit buys use maker fee (lower); stored as `buy_fee_rate` in position for precise calculations.

- **Compensation in Sell**:
  - Profit calc subtracts **buy_fee_rate + sell_fee** (sell_fee as taker for market, maker for limit).
  - Sell price for limits is inflated by fees + profit target + ATR buffer, ensuring net gain.
  - Example (assuming 0.1% maker/taker):
    - Buy: 0.1% fee â†’ Effective entry = avg_entry_price * (1 + 0.001).
    - Sell: Requires current_price >= effective entry * (1 + 0.008 + 0.001) to net 0.8% after sell fee.
  - Total round-trip compensation: Buffered into targets, preventing breakeven/loss trades.

Lower-tier fees (e.g., Tier 0 with near-zero rates) allow more frequent trades without code changes (dynamic fetch handles it).

#### 4. **How the Bot Profits**
The bot profits by buying oversold (near lower BB with oscillators confirming) in uptrends and selling at a fixed 0.8% net gain after fees, compounding over multiple trades. **Profits are not guaranteed, and you risk losing all or part of your investment.**

- **Strategy Overview**:
  - **Mean-Reversion + Comprehensive Filters**: Buys near lower BB (â‰¤1.005x) but only if RSI >50, MFI â‰¤70, MACD bullish, Stochastic oversold (K% â‰¤30), EMA > SMA, bullish patterns/momentum. Avoids weak trends.
  - **Profit Target**: Strict 0.8% net after fees; holds until target or bearish signals trigger market sell.
  - **Risk Management**: 10% allocation/trade, $2 buffer, no overlapping positions per coin, ATR buffers for slippage/volatility.
  - **Expected Win Rate**: Design aims for high-confidence entries; small gains (0.8%) but selective (filters minimize losses). Losses can exceed gains in adverse markets, potentially depleting your balance.

- **Profit Calculation Example**:
  - Balance: $100 USDT.
  - Buy SOLUSDT at $20 (limit, 0.1% fee): Alloc $9.8 (10% - buffer), qty=0.49 SOL, fee=$0.0098, effective cost=$9.8098.
  - Price rises to $20.30 (1.5% up).
  - Net profit check: (20.30 - 20) / 20 - (0.001 + 0.001) = 0.015 - 0.002 = 0.013 > 0.008 â†’ Sell if signals allow.
  - Sell (limit, 0.1% fee): Target price ~$20.36 (adjusted for fees/ATR), proceeds: $9.9564 - $0.00996 fee = $9.94644.
  - Profit: $9.94644 - $9.8098 = **$0.13664** (~1.39% gross, 0.8% net after fees).
  - **Risk Note**: If SOLUSDT drops, no sell unless profit target hit; no built-in stop-loss, risking loss.

- **Overall Profitability**:
  - Relies on all USDT pairs filtered by criteria, including imported assets.
  - Compounds: Selective trades at 0.8% net; minus losses (filters aim to minimize). 
  - Enhancements: 60d history for robust indicators, alerts/dashboard for monitoring, DB persistence for graceful shutdown/restart, pending order tracking for reliable fills.

### Installation in Ubuntu 24.04 Linux (Anaconda Python Environment Preferred)

For optimal isolation and management of dependencies, use Anaconda. This setup ensures a controlled Python environment, avoiding conflicts with system Python.

#### Step-by-Step Anaconda Installation
1. **Download the Anaconda Installer**:  
   Open a terminal and download the latest Linux installer (as of October 2025, check for updates at https://www.anaconda.com/download):  
   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Installer**:  
   Execute the script:  
   ```bash
   bash Anaconda3-2024.10-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```  
   - Press `Enter` to review the license.  
   - Scroll with `Space` and type `yes` to accept.  
   - Confirm the default path (e.g., `/home/yourusername/anaconda3`) by pressing `Enter`.  
   - Type `yes` to initialize Conda (this adds setup to `.bashrc`).

3. **Reload Shell Configuration**:  
   Apply changes:  
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```  
   Your terminal should show `(base)` indicating the base environment is active.

4. **Create a New Conda Environment**:  
   Create an isolated environment for the bot (e.g., with Python 3.11):  
   ```bash
   conda create -n trading_bot python=3.11
   ```  
   Activate it:  
   ```bash
   conda activate trading_bot
   ```  
   (To deactivate later: `conda deactivate`.)

5. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Inside the activated environment:  
   ```bash
   pip install python-binance ta-lib numpy pandas sqlalchemy requests tenacity
   ```  
   - Note: If `ta-lib` fails, install the system library first:  
     ### Simplified TA-Lib Installation (Version 0.6.4) on Ubuntu 24.04

To install the latest TA-Lib (v0.6.4) on Ubuntu 24.04:

1. **Install Build Tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y build-essential wget autoconf automake libtool pkg-config python3-dev python3-pip
   ```

2. **Download and Build TA-Lib**:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib/releases/download/v0.6.4/ta-lib-0.6.4-src.tar.gz
   tar -xzf ta-lib-0.6.4-src.tar.gz
   cd ta-lib-0.6.4
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make -j$(nproc)
   sudo make install
   sudo ldconfig
   ```

3. **Install Python TA-Lib (v0.6.8)**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install TA-Lib==0.6.8
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   pkg-config --modversion ta-lib  # Should show "0.6.4"
   python3 -c "import talib; print(talib.__version__)"  # Should show "0.6.8"
   ```

### Notes
- If `pip3 install` fails, try:
  ```bash
  TA_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include TA_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib pip3 install TA-Lib==0.6.8
  ```
- If errors occur during `./configure` or `make`, ensure all dependencies are installed or run `autoreconf -fiv` before `./configure`.

Let me know if you hit any issues!

6. **Verify Installation**:  
   Run `conda list` to check packages. Test Python:  
   ```bash
   python -c "print('Hello, Anaconda!')"
   ```

#### What to Add to `.bashrc` in Ubuntu Linux
The Anaconda installer automatically adds Conda initialization to `~/.bashrc` (e.g., export PATH and conda setup block). For the bot's environment variables (used via `os.getenv`), add these exports at the end of `~/.bashrc` (replace placeholders with your actual values):

```bash
# Environment variables for Billionaires Crypto Trading Robot
export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_binance_api_key_here"
export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_binance_api_secret_here"
export CALLMEBOT_API_KEY="your_callmebot_api_key_here"
export CALLMEBOT_PHONE="your_phone_number_here"  # E.g., +1234567890
```

- After editing, reload: `source ~/.bashrc`.
- **Security Tip**: Store sensitive keys securely (e.g., use a .env file and `python-dotenv` if preferred, but the code uses `os.getenv` directly). Avoid committing `.bashrc` to version control. Alternatively, place keys in a secure file and source it in `.bashrc`:  
  ```bash
  source /path/to/secure_env.sh
  ```

Run Program: 

```bash
conda activate 
python3 2025-coin-trading-bot.py
```

**Note**: Ensure the bot script is saved as `2025-coin-trading-bot.py`. Monitor logs in `crypto_trading_bot.log` for issues and the console dashboard for status. This setup is for educational use; live trading carries significant risks, including the potential to **lose all or part of your investment**, as outlined in the disclaimers. 

To set up CallMeBot for WhatsApp, visit https://www.callmebot.com/ and follow the instructions to get your API key and configure the service. Then, use `curl` or Python to send messages via the API.

This setup is for educational use; live trading carries significant risks, including the potential to **lose all or part of your investment**, as outlined in the disclaimers. 

The bot is not affiliated with or endorsed by Binance.US or CallMeBot. Always test in a simulation environment (e.g., Binance.US testnet) before deploying with real funds.
